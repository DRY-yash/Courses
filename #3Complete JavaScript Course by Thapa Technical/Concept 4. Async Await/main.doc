1. Synchronous JavaScript & Asynchronous JavaScript
1.1 Synchronous JavaScript
    - Doesn't do the next action until the previous code is executed.
    - does in order.


1.2 Asynchronous JavaScript
    - Does all the work without waiting for any previous aciton.

1.3 Async / Awaits
    - determines how to write the promises consume (getting) in simple and easy way.
    - Syntax async function *function name* () {};
    - async before a function tells a function to return promises.
    - await tells a function to wait for sometimes.

    - üôè Note : Avait tells function to wait for sometime to get the value if the value will be given after some time like if we are using setTimeout() method on it.
