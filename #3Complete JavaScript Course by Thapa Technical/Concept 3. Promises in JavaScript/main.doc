1. Promises : 
    - To keep track of what you are doing.
    - Keeps track of whether the event has happened already or not.
    - Determines what will happen after the event has happened/executed.
    - ðŸ”” Most Importantly we use it to eliminate the concept of callback hell ðŸ‘¿

2. Promise Stages : 
    -> Pending : 
        - cant say until the event is about to happen.
    -> resolve - fulfilled : 
        - success in executing the event.
    -> reject - not fulfilled :
        - failed to execute the event.

3. How to use Promise :
    -> 1st way : Using Promises Constructor.
        - new Promise();
        - A function is executed by the Constructor, during Constructoing promiseObj.
        - There are two parameters of callback function in promise => resolve , reject.
        - When we use promise there are two conditons resolve() and reject(), if we get the condition fulfilled we use resolve function else use reject function.
        - then() and catch() are the two methods used in promise.
        - use then() when we pass resolve function to promise , whatever value is in the resolve function will be accessed by then method's parameter.

        - catch() method is used to execute the reject function if resolve function() is not found.

    -> 2nd way : Using Promises Object.
