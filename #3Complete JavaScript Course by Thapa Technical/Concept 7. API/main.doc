1. What is API.
- API is nothing but a stored data on a link that anyone can use to make websites or elements.
- API is used to share data with other companies like how ticket sites know how many seats have been booked ü§î , YES Through API they give money to share data b/w themselves.

2. It works as promise SOOO -
- You can use Async Await or then() and catch() with it üßê.

3. how to catch
- when we have some error in getting the data related to code not the api then .catch() works as charm.
- But when we have given wrong api link or the browser is unable to load the data then .catch() doesn't get executed for that error.

4. Async Await is also acceptable.

5. We can also use Async Await's try() , catch() method for better error handling.
