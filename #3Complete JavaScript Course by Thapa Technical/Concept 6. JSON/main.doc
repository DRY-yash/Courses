1. What is JSON?
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
- JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
- JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
- JSON is a lightweight data interchange format.
- 🧐 Previously we used XML for this purpose but now we use JSON as it is very fast and lightweight.

1.1 why it is used for ?
- It is a data format that can communicate through multiple programming languages and transfer it.
- like it can be used to transfer data between frontend like JavaScript to backend like php.
- When accessing JSON Ajax is very important.

2. JSON Data Types
- string
- Number
- Object
- Array
- Boolean
- Null

- Cant use -> function , date and undefined as JSON value.

3. JSON Syntax Rules
- Data is in key value pair(as it is an JS Object 😀).
- Curly braces hold objects.
- Square brackets hold arrays.
- keys and value pair must be in double quotes("").
☝️ And this is the basic difference between JSON and a nomral JS object, that JSON accepts all data as string so we need to use double quotes in both key and value pair names.

4. JSON.stringify(); 
- converts JavaScript object into JSON object.

5. JSON.parse();
- converts JSON Object into JS Object.
