1. What is HTML5?
        HTML 5 is a markup language.
        Developed by W3C(world wide web console) and WHATWG(web hypertext application application technology working group).

2. Why HTML5?
        - New Elements and attributes were introduced
            eg:- Doctype has been simplified.
            Characted encoding is also very simplified.
        - All elements and attributes are supported in all web browsers.

    tags ->
        - <article> (defines an article).
