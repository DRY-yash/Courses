        /* 1. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.*/  //See Above Point no 03
        /* 2. A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing -- hence the name 'call back'.*/
        const funA = () => {
            setTimeout(function () {
                console.log(`welcome FunA`);
            }, 3000);
        }

        const funB = () => {
            console.log(`Welcome FunB`);
        }

        // funA();  //funA get called after funB
        // funB();  //funB get called before funA

        //you can clearly see funB shows first then funA , So to avoid these circumtances we use a callback function, which doesn't allow a function to execute before a particular function is finished executing.

        // Callback function example
        const perOne = (friend, callfrnd) => {
            console.log(`I am busy right now. I am talking to ${friend}. I will call you back.`);
            callfrnd(); //imp
        }

        const perTwo = () => {
            console.log(`Hey what's up. I call back you dekha.`);
        }

        perOne("Thapa", perTwo);  //this is an example of callback function(calling a function as an argument of another function.);
